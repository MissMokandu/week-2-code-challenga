    <h1>Planning a Brunch Date? Letâ€™s Make It Count ðŸ¥‚âœ¨</h1>
    <section id="introductorySection">
        <p>Iâ€™m planning a little brunch hangout and Iâ€™d love to have you there. Whether itâ€™s been a while since we all caught up or we just need an excuse to eat good food and laugh a lot, this is the vibe.</p>
        <p>To make things easier (and avoid last-minute stress), Iâ€™ve put together this RSVP form. If you're in, just fill it outâ€”only those who RSVP will be counted in for the reservation.</p>
        <p>No pressure if you can't make it, but Iâ€™d really appreciate knowing either way. Canâ€™t wait to chill, eat, and catch up with whoever shows up. ðŸ’›</p>
